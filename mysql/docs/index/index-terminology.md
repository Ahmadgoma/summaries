Metadata | Metadata is “the data about the data.” Anything that describes the database as opposed to being the contents of the database is metadata. Thus column names, database names, user names, version names, and most of the string results from `SHOW` are metadata. This is also true of the contents of tables in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` because those tables by definition contain information about database objects.
