# Introduction to Software Design and Architecture

## Welcome to Software Design and Architecture
Take a minute and think of the projects that you worked on.
* Did they have a good design?
* Could the design be done better?
* Was there even a design at all?
* How do you know if the software was well-designed?
* Think of how easy it was to make changes to your code.
* Did a small code change produce a ripple-effect for changes elsewhere in the code?
* Was your code hard to reuse?
* Was the software difficult to maintain after a release?

What is software design and architecture?/
How does it improve your software products?/

Consider this scenario. You join a project that's been in development for a while. You look at the code and become instantly overwhelmed. You can't tell what the purpose of the pieces are, things are unorganized, and design documentation is non-existent. You don't even know where to begin. These are all signs that the project was not well-designed from the outset. Or let's say that you are now working on a personal development project.
