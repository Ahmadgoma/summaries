# Welcome to Software Design and Architecture
Take a minute and think of the projects that you worked on.
* Did they have a good design?
* Could the design be done better?
* Was there even a design at all?
* How do you know if the software was well-designed?
* Think of how easy it was to make changes to your code.
* Did a small code change produce a ripple-effect for changes elsewhere in the code?
* Was your code hard to reuse?
* Was the software difficult to maintain after a release?

Then you need to know about software design and architecture.

**What is software design and architecture? How does it improve your software products?**<br>
software design and architecture let you know how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems. You will know how to express in document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation.<br>
If You can't tell what the purpose of the pieces are or things are unorganized and design documentation is non-existent or You don't even know where to begin.<br>
This is what software design and architecture try to solve.

> This course try to align the ACM/IEEE software engineering curriculum guidelines.

This specialization consists of four courses.

## First course (object-oriented design).
This course will build upon the basics of Java and take you to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create flexible, reusable, and maintainable software by applying object oriented design principles. You will learn how to communicate these designs by expressing them in a visual notation known as Unified Modeling Language or UML. In the first capstone project, you will be challenged to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by evolving and documenting a Java codebase with corresponding UML documentation. 

## Second course (design patterns).
Design issues and applications can be resolved through design patterns commonly applied by experts. The second course extends your knowledge of object-oriented analysis and design by covering design patterns used in interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns, you will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally, you will learn how to identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells. In the second capstone project, you will be challenged to redesign an application to use design patterns.

## Third course (software architecture).
By the third course, you will be equipped with software design patterns and principles and will be ready to learn how architecture can be used as a basis for organizing the software systems found in industry today. Through a review of architectural styles, you will explore the structure and behavior of large scale software systems. Specific UML diagrams will express important architectural perspectives. You will learn how to analyze and evaluate a given architecture by examining the trade-offs between competing quality attributes such as modifiabilty and performance. In the capstone project in this course, you will document and evaluate the architecture of a layered Java system. 

## Fourth course (service-oriented architecture).
Based on the understanding of architectural styles that you learned in the third course, you will review architectures for web applications. You will then explore the basics of service-oriented architecture or SOA in two approaches, web services and representational state transfer or REST architecture. In the final capstone project, you will connect a mobile application with a variety of REST interfaces to access storage, search, and computation services. By the end of this specialization, you'll know how to design it right. Our courses are designed to be taken in sequential order.

# Software Architect and Design Roles in Industry
## Software designer role
would be responsible for outlining a software solution to a specific problem by designing the details of individual components and their responsibilities.
## Software architect role
would be responsible for looking at the entire system and choosing appropriate frameworks, data storage, solutions and determining how components interact with each other.

That brings us to the primary difference between software design and software architecture. In short, software design looks at the lower level aspects of a system, whereas software architecture tends to look at the bigger picture, the higher level aspects of a system. <br>
Think of this like designing a building. An architect focuses on the major structures and services, while an interior designer focuses on the smaller spaces within.
